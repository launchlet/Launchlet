_Generalized interface for keyboard-based interaction_

Launchlet is a simple way to add a name to snippets of code and then run it. Inspired by [Quicksilver](LCH_VITRINE_QUICKSILVER_URL), it functions primarily via mouseless interaction and lets you access your [Recipes](LCHVitrineTokenGuideURL) with a few keyboard strokes. You can also use it to customize websites in the same way as 'userscripts' or 'userstyles'. Optimized to be fast so that you can 'think then do'.

Check out the demos below for some ideas or [compose](LCHVitrineTokenComposeURL) your own.

You can run Launchlet as a bookmarklet, [browser extension](LCH_SHARED_EXTENSION_DOCS_URL), or as a [module](LCH_SHARED_PACKAGE_DOCS_URL) in your own project to add a 'jump to' functionality.

The code is open-source and available on [GitHub](LCH_SHARED_GITHUB_URL).

The project is freely accessible but if you are in a position to give, please [donate](LCH_SHARED_DONATE_URL) to support future development.
